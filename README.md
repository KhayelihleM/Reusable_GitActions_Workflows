Reusable Autotagging Workflows
Author: Khayelihle Manyathi
Purpose: Automate semantic version tagging and release notes generation for multiple repositories using GitHub Actions.

This repository contains two workflows:

Autotagging Workflow â€“ reusable workflow that automatically tags and generates friendly release notes.

Caller Workflow â€“ example workflow demonstrating how to call the autotagging workflow from another repository.

ðŸ”¹ Autotagging Workflow
A reusable GitHub Actions workflow that:

Reads commit messages using Conventional Commits.

Determines the next semantic version (major.minor.patch).

Generates human-friendly release notes (no raw filenames).

Creates a GitHub release with the new tag.

How It Works
Trigger: workflow_call (can be called from other workflows).

Analyze Commits:

feat: â†’ minor

fix: â†’ patch

BREAKING CHANGE: â†’ major

Generate Tag: Semantic version tag (e.g., v1.2.0).

Generate Release Notes: Replace filenames with friendly terms (Application, Blog, CI pipeline, etc.).

Publish Release: Push the tag and release to GitHub automatically.

ðŸ”¹ Caller Workflow Example
This workflow demonstrates calling the Autotagging Workflow from another repository.

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: Call Autotagging

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    uses: khayelihlem/reusable-autotagging-workflows/.github/workflows/autotagging.yml@main
    with:
      repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      release-branch: main
How it Works:

uses: points to the reusable workflow URL and branch.

with: allows passing parameters (like token, branch, etc.).

Executes the autotagging process in the target repository without duplicating logic.

âœ… Benefits
Consistency: All repos follow the same tagging rules.

Reusability: Update the workflow once, use everywhere.

Automation: No manual version bumps.

Professional Releases: Clear, readable release notes for all stakeholders.

ðŸ“¦ Setup
Copy the caller workflow into your repo under .github/workflows/.

Ensure your repo uses Conventional Commits.

Push to main (or configured branch) to trigger autotagging.

Check the Releases page for the new tag and notes.
